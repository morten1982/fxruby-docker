FXRuby Dockerfile
=================
This is a basic dockerfile to create a docker image that runs FXRuby. The intent was to have a docker image you can pull down on any
OS and run your GUI application. There are some OS specific requirements but hopefully not too many. Obviously on all platforms,
working docker is a requirement. A sample app is included to test the installation.


On Linux:
---------
It should just work.


On MacOS:
---------
Install XQuartz
